	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, as it helps in predicting the amount of time an algorithm will take to complete. Understanding time complexity helps developers choose the most efficient algorithm for their needs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It is important for determining how much memory is required for an algorithm to run effectively. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) will use memory proportional to the input size n, making it important to consider for large datasets.</p>
